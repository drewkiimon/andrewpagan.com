# A New Start

It's been about a week since my last day at Reputation.com, and since then I've
had some time to reflect on what I liked, what I didn't like, what I want to do
in the future, and how I'm going to improve in the future. It's no surprise that
the pandemic has exposed the cracks in our system, and that was not exclusive to
government policies. It really made me realize at Reputation that I loved the
people a lot more than the mission and projects.

**Do not get me wrong**. I enjoyed Reputation while I was there. It was my first
real developer job with development cycles, more than one other engineer to talk
to, and gave me many opportunities to take leadership on projects. I feel very
fortunate to be able to be a lead frontend engineer on a major project for the
platform, and it really forced me to learn at a fast pace.

## If it was so great, why did you leave?

_"Well if you loved it so much then why leave?"_. That really is the million
dollar question here. I see so many people write posts like "Wow, **X** was such
an amazing company. I love it so much and it pains me so much to leave..." blah
blah blah. I think if you loved it so much, why would you leave? There has to be
some driving force that makes you start looking for the next job, otherwise...
Did you really love it? You can love the people, but hate the work. You can love
the perks of the office, but hate the culture. When it comes down to it, you can
love many things about a company you work for, but there has to be something you
don't like / hate that makes you say "I'm getting the hell out of here".

For me, there was a few things:

- Not feeling heard
- Low total compensation
- I no longer aligned with the company mission

**This post is not to bash Reputation**. I repeat, it is not to bash. This is
just me talking about what led me to leave the company.
